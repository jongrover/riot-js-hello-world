# Hello Riot.js

Playing with the Riot.js micro framework by building a simple hello world example except my example displays a name of a person instead or "world".

Framework at: [http://riotjs.com/](http://riotjs.com/)

## Instructions

To view locally, you must run Riot.js apps on a localhost server because Riot uses AJAX to load the tag files! To do so,

1. Install Node and npm
2. In Terminal run $ `npm install -g live-server` to install node live server.
3. Then run $ `live-server` from the same folder as your Riot.js project.
4. Open your browser at: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` to see your app.
